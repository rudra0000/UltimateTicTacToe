# UltimateTicTacToe

UltimateTicTacToe is a Python implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. This project uses the Minimax algorithm to create an unbeatable AI opponent, making the game an interesting challenge for players. The interface of the game is created using Pygame.

## Features

- Classic Tic Tac Toe gameplay
- Unbeatable AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm
- Interactive graphical interface built with Pygame
- Simple and intuitive design


## Installation

To run UltimateTicTacToe, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you'll need to install the required libraries. Follow the steps below to set up the game:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UltimateTicTacToe.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd UltimateTicTacToe
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip3 install pygame
    ```

## How to Play

1. Run the game:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
2. Click on the grid to make your move. The AI will respond with its move.
3. The game continues until there is a winner or the grid is full (resulting in a draw).

## Minimax Algorithm

The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm, typically used in turn-based games, for minimizing the possible loss in a worst-case scenario. It is used in UltimateTicTacToe to ensure that the AI opponent plays optimally, making it impossible to defeat.
